Here’s what you can expect:

1. **Tech Articles** — Flutter, IoT, and modern web development
2. **Tutorials & Code Snippets**
3. **Project Stories** — Real challenges and solutions
4. **Random Thoughts** — Because not everything needs a category 😉

Some areas that excite me:

- Flutter & Mobile Development
- Internet of Things (IoT)
