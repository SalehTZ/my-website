## Introduction

In the previous level, we used `find` to search within a specific directory. Now, in Bandit Level 6 to 7, we're taking the training wheels off. The password file could be anywhere on the entire server, and we must once again use its properties to locate it.

This level introduces the challenge of running a search with broad scope, which often generates a lot of noise. We will learn how to filter out that noise to find exactly what we're looking for.

## The Challenge: Level 6 Goal

The goal for this level is to find a file somewhere on the server that matches all of the following criteria:

> - owned by user **bandit7**
> - owned by group **bandit6**
> - 33 bytes in size

This requires us to search from the very top of the filesystem hierarchy.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let's construct the command to hunt down this file.

### Step 1: Log into `bandit6`

Use the password from the last level to SSH into the `bandit6` user.

```bash
ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
````

### Step 2: Building the `find` Command

We'll use `find` again, but with a different starting point and new tests.

1. **Starting Path:** To search the entire server, we must start from the root directory, which is represented by a single forward slash (`/`).

      - `find /`

2. **Owner User:** The file is owned by `bandit7`. The test for this is `-user`.

      - `-user bandit7`

3. **Owner Group:** The file belongs to the group `bandit6`. The test is `-group`.

      - `-group bandit6`

4. **File Size:** The file is `33` bytes in size. We use `-size` with the `c` suffix for bytes.

      - `-size 33c`

### Step 3: Running the Command and Dealing with Errors

Let's combine these parts and run the command.

```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
```

When you run this, you will see the correct file path, but it will be buried in a long stream of "Permission denied" errors. This happens because our user, `bandit6`, does not have permission to read every directory on the server. These error messages are sent to a special channel called **standard error (stderr)**.

```bash
find: ‘/var/spool/cron/atjobs’: Permission denied
find: ‘/var/spool/rsyslog’: Permission denied
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
find: ‘/var/log/apache2’: Permission denied
...
```

### Step 4: The Solution - Redirecting Standard Error

To clean up our output, we can redirect all the error messages (`stderr`) to a special location called `/dev/null`, which is like a black hole that discards any data sent to it.

In Linux, `stderr` is represented by the file descriptor `2`. We use `2>/dev/null` to redirect it.

Let's try our command again with this addition.

```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```

This time, the output is perfectly clean, showing only the path to the file we were looking for.

```bash
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

### Step 5: Read the Password

With the exact path in hand, we can now use `cat` to retrieve the password for `bandit7`.

```bash
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

```bash
# yours might be different
morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
```

## Key Concepts Learned

1. **Global File Searches:** We learned to use `/` as the starting point for `find` to search the entire filesystem.
2. **User and Group Predicates:** The `-user` and `-group` tests are powerful additions to our `find` toolkit, allowing us to search based on file ownership.
3. **Standard Streams (`stdout` & `stderr`):** We saw a practical example of the two main output streams: standard output (for successful results) and standard error (for error messages).
4. **Error Redirection (`2>/dev/null`):** Redirecting `stderr` is a critical skill for scripting and for making command-line output readable when errors are expected.

## Conclusion

You've successfully performed a server-wide search and learned how to manage command output streams. This is a significant milestone that moves you from basic commands to more advanced system administration techniques.

Save the password you found and get ready for the next level\!
