## Introduction: The Password with a Flair for Drama

You've mastered finding unique lines with `sort` and `uniq`, and you're already a `grep` wizard for simple word searches. But what if the password isn't just a word, but a line marked by a very specific, almost theatrical, preamble? Welcome to **Bandit Level 9**, where the password proudly announces itself with a string of equal signs.

The level description for Bandit Level 9 states:

> *The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable lines, preceded by several '====' characters.*

"Preceded by several '====' characters." This is a perfect job for `grep`, but we need to tell `grep` to look for lines that *start* with this specific pattern. It's like finding a treasure chest that always has a big "X" painted directly on its lid.

## Level 9: `grep` - The Pattern Matcher (Anchors Away!)

You've just logged in as `bandit9` with the password from Level 8. A quick `ls` will confirm the target file:

{{< highlight bash >}}
ls
{{< /highlight >}}

You'll see:

```
data.txt
```

Again, if you `cat data.txt`, you'll likely be overwhelmed by a lot of seemingly random text. We need to be more precise than a simple `grep`.

### `grep` with Start-of-Line Matching (`^`)

You already know `grep` searches for patterns. What you might not know is that `grep` understands basic regular expressions. One of the most useful regular expression characters is the **caret (`^`)**.

* `^`: In `grep`, the caret means "the beginning of the line."

So, if we want to find lines that start with "====", we combine the caret with our pattern: `^====`.

The command to find our password will be:

{{< highlight bash >}}
grep '^====' data.txt
{{< /highlight >}}

Type this into your terminal and press Enter. `grep` will diligently scan `data.txt` and print out any lines that begin with four or more equal signs.

The output should be a single line, something like:

```
==== [THIS IS YOUR PASSWORD] ====
```

The string of characters between the `====` signs is your password for `bandit10`! Copy it down carefully.

### Moving Onward:

Got that password? You're a regex master in the making!

{{< highlight bash >}}
exit
{{< /highlight >}}

And now, for the next challenge:

{{< highlight bash >}}
ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
{{< /highlight >}}

Enter your hard-won password, and you're logged into `bandit10`. You're getting dangerously good at this!

## Conclusion: `grep` - Your Precision Tool

You've successfully conquered Bandit Level 9, refining your `grep` skills to pinpoint specific patterns:

* Using the `^` (caret) character to match patterns at the **beginning of a line**.
* Applying this knowledge to extract crucial information from noisy files.

Understanding basic regular expressions within `grep` (and other Linux tools) is a powerful skill for anyone working with text data. It allows for highly precise and efficient searches.

## SPOILER ALERT: Short Answer for Bandit Level 9

1.  Log in as `bandit9`.
2.  Use `grep` to find the line starting with `====`:
    {{< highlight bash >}}
    grep '^====' data.txt
    {{< /highlight >}}
3.  The output contains the password for `bandit10`.
4.  Copy the password.
