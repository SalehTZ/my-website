<!-- # Flutter 3.35.0 is Here â€” and Iâ€™m Proud to Be Part of It -->

Flutter 3.35.0 has officially landed, bringing a host of improvements across **web**, **desktop**, **accessibility**, **UI components**, and **tooling**.

<!--more-->

This release is special for me â€” **my own contribution** is included:

> **Fix text selection toolbar alignment for RTL languages**  
> by [@SalehTZ](https://github.com/SalehTZ) in [#169854](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/169854)  

This fix improves the user experience for **right-to-left languages** like Persian, Arabic and others by ensuring the text selection toolbar aligns correctly, making editing smoother and more intuitive for millions of users.
